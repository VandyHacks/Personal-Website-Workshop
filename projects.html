                        TotTernary is a system for using ultra-wideband RF time-of-flight ranging to perform indoor
                        ranging and localization. It incorporates the SquarePoint module, containing the DecaWave
                        DW1000 for UWB packet transmission and timestamping. The module provides node-to-node ranges
                        over an I2C interface which can then be sent further on using the radio on the mother board.
                        I have picked up the work on this project where it left off, working to troubleshoot existing
                        identified bugs such as calibration issues.

                            This project was created to assist my course taught at Exploration Summer Schools. It displays
                            a collection of Processing projects in a neat format that is easily understandable by museum attendees.
                            The project was created using Processing Java which is NOT the best to design a Graphical User Interface. This
                            is so I could explain the code to my students in an effort to let them understand the code that would
                            be displaying their own projects. It was an attempt at a learning opportunity but I think it just
                            normalized hack-y code for them.
